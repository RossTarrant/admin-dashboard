# Admin Dashboard

**PROJECT SUMMARY:**

The aim for this project was to create the interface for a mock admin dashboard that could be used. There was no specific guidelines, however I was encouraged to make strong use of CSS Grid which I have been learning over the past week. CSS Grid made structuring the page very simple to do, however I did encounter a few issues along the way that made the project challenging. This project allowed me to consolidate all of my learning of CSS Grid.

_**Some of the things I have learned from completing this project:**_

- How CSS Grid can be used to structure a page. This project consolidated all of my understanding of CSS Grid so far, I was able to very specifically place individual elements exactly where I wanted them on the page thanks to how simple CSS Grid is with its design.

- The importance of planning out your project and your design before beginning to program it. When I initially started my design I had not planned how how I wanted my design to look, and this caused some issues during the implementation. I very quickly learned the importance of taking the time to plan out the layout of the web page prior to actually creating it.

- How flexbox can be used WITH CSS Grid. At first, I was under the impression you could either use flex OR grid to create the design of your page. However I soon realised you can combine the two in a single page based on the needs of your design. Flex was used in the nav bar at the top.

_**Some of the challenges I faced during this project:**_

- Getting the elements of the page (e.g. the 'Your Projects' section, the 'Announcements' and 'Trending' sections to all line up correctly with each other. I spent a lot of time trying to line these elements up perfectly which proved to be very challenging.

- Planning out the structure of the page was a challenge that I had to overcome. At first glance, the project may seem simplistic with just needing to arrange a side bar, nav bar and some content. But if you glance into each section further you will see that it is much more complex than that. For example, the nav bar is laid out so that it has the word "Hello there," in a smaller font DIRECTLY above the name of the user. This was achieved by having containers inside of other containers and planning each container to be a relevant layout format. For example, the Nav bar itself was placed where it is using Grid but then the inner containers are positioned using Flex.

_**If I was to spend more time on this project I would:**_

- Add more interactive elements to the page. The page is mostly static, with just a few CSS transformations for when you hover over different elements of the page. If I had more time I would like to add more interactivity to the page and maybe even further pages.

- Make the page more responsive to different devices that may be used to view the page. The project was mainly focused on consolidating my understanding of CSS Grid and not about responsive design. I did add some responsive elements to the page, but as a whole it is not responsive. With more time I would like to think about how I can restructure my design so that it could be viewed on different devices/screen sizes.
